== SLES 12 Installation


.Version Information
[NOTE]
&susemgr;
 3.1 was originally released as a SLES 12 SP2 extension.
With the next maintenance update (2017), &susemgr;
 3.1 will be based on SLES 12 SP3 and it will support SLE 12 SP3 clients officially.
In the following sections and chapters, it is highly recommended to use SLE 12 SP3 instead of SP2.


== SLES 12 KVM Requirements
Hello world this is a test!

This chapter provides the required (kvm) settings for installation of &sls;
 12 media as the base for the &susemgr; 3.1.
A kernel virtual machine (kvm) combined with Virtual Machine Manager (``virt-manager``) will be used as a sandbox for this installation.

Enter the following settings when creating a new virtual machine using ``virt-manager``.

== SLES 12 KVM Settings


This section provides guidance on installation of &susemgr;

This section assumes you have previously setup an account with SCC and downloaded the SLES 12 full installation media.

.Procedure: Preparing for SLES 12 Installation
. In `virt-manager` select menu:File[] then menu:New Virtual Machine[] .
. Choose menu:Local install media (ISO image or CDROM).[]
. Ensure menu:Use ISO Image[] is selected then click menu:Browse[] and locate the full SLES 12 image you downloaded from your SCC account.
. Configure your machine with at least 4096 MB RAM and a minimum of 2 CPUs.
. Create a storage device with a minimum of 230 GB storage space for the installation. During the partitioning setup of the SLES 12 installation this disk should be partitioned into a 4 GB `swap` a 130 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]_/var/spacewalk/_ (XFS) and an additional 50 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]_/var/lib/pgsql/_ (XFS). The remaining storage space will be used by the operating system. Select menu:Finish[] to begin the installation.
